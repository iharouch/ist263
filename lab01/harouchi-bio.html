    <body>
        My name is Ines Harouchi. I am an international student from Morocco double majoring in Economics and Applied Data Analytics with a minor in Psychology. I’m interested in using data to examine global economic markets as well as incorporating psychology to understand the factors that influence consumer behavior. Through my studies, I gained a strong foundation in econometrics and building statistical models. I am also proficient in Python, R, SQL, Excel, and PowerBI. Outside of work, I greatly enjoy reading books about the thousands of different lives that I could be living, and I make it a goal each year to beat the number of books read from the previous year. My current favorite book is The Book Thief by Markus Zusak. My other hobbies include watching soccer, cooking, and design, and I’m always looking for new ways to engage with these interests using my professional skills.
