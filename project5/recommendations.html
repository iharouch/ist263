    <p>A collection of my favorite places and experiences at Syracuse: study spots, good eats, and traditions. These are all the things that make campus feel like home. <br><br>
    </p>

    <p>STUDY SPOTS <br>
       <ul>
        <li><strong>Eggers Café</strong> – Located on the 3rd floor of Eggers Hall, this cute café has large windows that bring in lots of daylight, a sandwich bar, and a quiet study space.</li>
        <li><strong>2nd Floor of Bird Library</strong> – Bird Library is the most popular library on campus, and my favorite thing is that, as you go up its levels, each floor gets quieter. The second floor has my favorite layout!</li>
        <li><strong>Panasci Lounge</strong> – Located in Schine, this open room upstairs has a variety of seatings options, including couches, comfy chairs, and regular study tables. I find that it is a very cozy option with a great view of campus!</li>
       </ul><br>
