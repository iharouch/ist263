    <h3>Your go-to guide for surviving (and thriving!) during your first year.</h3>

    <p>
    As a former peer mentor, I’ve gathered all the advice, tips, and resources that I used to share with my
    first-year students into one place. Whether you’re figuring out what to pack, how to register for classes,
    or how to get involved, this guide is here to make the transition less stressful! <br><br>
    </p>

    <p>ALL THINGS DORMS <br><br>
    Starting with the place you’ll probably be spending the most time in, your dorm will be a space that you
    want to keep cozy and personal. <br><br>

    SU has around 20 residence halls and they all offer a different living experience. Although you aren’t
    technically able to pick the dorm building you live in, there is a way to narrow the options. Syracuse has
    what we call Living Learning Communities (LLCs), which are communities of students who share similar
    interests living together. There are a range of interests from being in the Honors Program to wanting to
    live with a diverse student body in the Multicultural LLC! As an honors student who lived in the LLC, I
    strongly recommend joining one as it is a great way to meet students who share your interests early on.
    LLCs put on events for their residents, so take advantage of the fact that you’d be near like-minded
    people with the opportunity to attend free events in your building. Personally, I strongly recommend the
    Honors LLC in Sadler Hall, but I might be a bit biased! <br><br>

    Depending on what you are interested in, you can indicate that you would like to live in an LLC when you
    sign up for housing, and if you get a spot, you were technically able to choose your dorm building! This
    <a href=https://experience.syracuse.edu/llc/join/llc-options/ target="blank"> page</a> has the list of available LLCs along with the residence hall that you would be living in. <br><br>

    In terms of what to pack for your dorm, this is my list of <strong>essentials</strong>: <br> 
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No more than 7 pairs of shoes</strong> – you’ll need 2 pairs of everyday shoes, 1 pair of dress-up shoes,
        1 pair of shower shoes, 1 pair of outdoor sneakers, 1 pair of inside shoes, and 1 pair of
        snowshoes. I don’t recommend bringing any more as these take up a lot of space in your closet
        and are truly all you need for any occasion.</li>
        <li><strong>A fan</strong> – You might be telling yourself that this item can be skipped over since we live in upstate
        NY, which has a reputation for being very cold. WRONG! The first month or two usually has hot
        and sunny weather and the dorms do not have AC, so you’ll be glad to have a fan in your room.</li>
        <li><strong>Extension cords</strong> – Most dorms do not have many outlets, and it makes it annoying when you
        want your lamp to be on but also need to charge your phone. Therefore, extension cords are a
        great way to make charging more accessible and available (just make sure to get a surge
        protector as some types of cords aren’t allowed)!</li>
        <li><strong>A foldable drying rack</strong> – Once you start doing your own laundry, you’ll realize a lot more items
        of clothing can’t go in the dryer than you initially thought. Having a drying rack for delicate
        clothing is very handy and it barely takes up any space if it folds.</li>
        <li><strong>Another light source</strong> – Whether this is a desk lamp, floor lamp, or LED lights, I recommend
        getting another light source other than the ceiling light as those are generally not very strong. I
        may just be a sucker for bright rooms, but my freshman year dorm felt so dim and dull before I
        got a floor lamp. My personal preference is getting a yellow light bulb to make it feel warmer!</li>
        <li><strong>A water filter</strong> – Dorm buildings don’t always have the cleanest drinking water, so getting a
        BRITA filter or something similar is useful for filling up your bottle in your room!</li>
        <li><strong>A mattress topper</strong> – You’ll quickly realize that dorm mattresses are some of the hardest surfaces
        you’ve sat on before. Getting a mattress topper will be a game changer and you’ll feel like
        you’re sleeping in a cloud.</li>
        <li><strong>A reusable water bottle</strong> – Campus is big and hilly, so you’ll want to stay hydrated. Having a
        reusable water bottle makes it very easy to do so as there are a bunch of water fountains across
        campus.</li>
        <li><strong>Memorabilia</strong> – Lastly, bring photos, posters, and trinkets that will make your room feel like
        home! Making your room personal is the first step in feeling comfortable on campus and a great
        way to have some pieces of family and friends with you.</li>
    </ul>

    Although this isn’t a comprehensive list of everything that you should pack for college, it covers some
    underrated essentials that tend to slip people’s minds. <br><br>

    <p>ACADEMICS 101 <br><br>
    
    Registering for classes can be stressful, especially when MySlice starts crashing from all the traffic. So,
    here are my top tips to prepare for registration season:

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Start early</strong> - Class information will come out a couple of weeks before actual registration, so I
        recommend going through all your options as early as possible. This allows you to plan exactly
        for what you are looking for as well as gives you time to talk to your advisor if you need a second
        opinion (advisor appointment timeslots fill up VERY fast during this time, so plan ahead).</li>
        <li><strong>Have backups</strong> - Students register for classes based on grade level, so as freshman, you
        unfortunately have last pick. This means that you might not always get your first choice in
        classes or sections as they fill up fast. Therefore, I recommend having one or two backups ready
        in your shopping cart so that you’re not missing out on important credits.</li>
        <li><strong>Be ready</strong> - Once you have planned everything out, add all your classes to your shopping cart,
        including your backups, so that you are able to enroll as soon as your registration time opens.
        Classes fill up fast, so make sure to be on MySlice at least 5 minutes before your appointment. In
        addition, registration is often in the morning, so if you have a class, it is okay to ask your
        professor if you can take 5 minutes to register for class on that day!</li>
    </ul>

    Next, here are my top 5 tips to have a successful first semester:

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Seprate your spaces</strong> – Since your new home is a small dorm room, it gets difficult to differentiate between your personal and work spaces. Therefore, I suggest avoiding doing work on your bed and leave that as a place for resting. Even better if you can find other spots on campus to study and separate your spaces more distinctly. </li>
        <li><strong>Attend office hours</strong> – Going to office hours regularly allows to have all your questions answered and stay on top of course material, but it also allows you to build a relationship with your professors. When it comes to graduate school or scholarship applications, it’ll be very helpful to have a faculty member who knows you well enough to agree to write you a recommendation letter! </li>
        <li><strong>Track your assignments</strong> – There are a lot of deadlines to keep track of in college, so having a place where you write them all down is a great way to stay organized. I personally use a color-coded Excel sheet to keep track of my work as well as how far along I am, but you can also use a physical format if that works better for you! </li>
        <li><strong>Don't procrastinate your assignments</strong> – This is a cliché piece of advice you’ll hear often, but it doesn’t make it any less true. Assignments start to pile up and soon enough you have three midnight deadlines. Starting early allows you to decide how long each assignment will take to complete and plan for time to ask for feedback from your professors if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Take breaks</strong> – After a while, the academic routine can take a toll on your mental health, so it is very important that you take breaks and take care of yourself. Make sure that you are leaving time to call home, hangout with friends, and pursue personal hobbies to stay in the right headspace.</li>
    </ul> <br>
    </p>

    <p>GETTING INVOLVED <br><br>
    Outside of classes, my biggest piece of advice for an incoming freshman is getting involved on campus. A
    lot of people feel out of place in a new environment, especially when you don’t have a community to
    rely on and to keep you busy. Therefore, I strongly recommend signing up for 1-2 student organizations
    your first semester. This will give you the opportunity to meet other students with similar interests and
    take your mind off work for a couple hours a week. Leadership experiences in clubs are also a great skill
    to add to your resume! <br>

    SU holds an involvement fair in the first 3 weeks of each semester where all the clubs on campus are
    present and tell you how you can join them. This is the main event that you should go to your first
    semester, and don’t be afraid to look at all the options until you find the ones that work for you! <br><br>
