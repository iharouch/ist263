            <h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Ines, and I’m a student at Syracuse University double majoring in Economics and Data
            Analytics with a minor in Psychology. When I first got here my freshman year, I was overwhelmed by the
            size of our campus, the number of student organizations, and just navigating college in general. Now
            that I’m a senior (they’re not lying when they say that time flies by), I have a better handle on what it
            means to be a student at Syracuse University, and I’ve figured out college so that you don’t have to on
            your own! This site is where I’ll be documenting everything I wish I knew as freshman, including my
            survival guide to freshman year, tips, and recommendations. Enjoy! </p> </div>

            <h2>A GLIMPSE OF SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY</h2>
            <p>Syracuse University is a private university in Syracuse, New York (aka upstate NY, so get ready for long
            winters). It’s home to 13 schools and colleges, more than 300 student organizations, over 200 majors,
            and a unique mascot, Otto the Orange! Whether you’re watching a game at the Dome, attending one of
            our many free student events, or grabbing a bite on Marshall Street, there’s always something going on!</p>

            <h2>FROM ONE STUDENT TO ANOTHER </h2>
            <p>As an international student from Morocco, I was nervous to move to a college alone and far away from
            big cities. I was apprehending the typical things: choosing a major (I came here as an undecided
            student), making friends, living in a dorm, and making the most of my education. However, the first
            couple of days of Orientation Week confirmed that I had made the best decision for me. Although it
            took me a couple of weeks to get into a routine, adapt to college-level courses, and find my place on
            campus, it only took two days to establish that I had found my new home. <br><br>
            During my sophomore year, I was a Peer Mentor to two groups of international students. I would meet
            with them weekly and share information about important school resources like DegreeWorks and
            BlackBoard, but I would also share my personal advice on life as an SU student. Therefore, I’m to share
            that advice with the rest of you! <br><br>
            Now that I’m starting my last year, I would honestly rank my experience at SU a 10/10. I’ve made
            lifelong friends, joined incredible student organizations, networked with faculty and industry
            professionals, and even studied abroad! I’ve compiled all my knowledge about SU into this website in
            the hopes that your experience can be just as good as mine. </p>
