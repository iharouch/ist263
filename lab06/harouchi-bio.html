        <h1>Ines Harouchi's Biography</h1>

        <p>
            My name is Ines Harouchi. I am an international student from <strong>Morocco</strong> double majoring in Economics and Applied Data Analytics with a minor in Psychology. Iâ€™m interested in using data to examine global economic markets as well as incorporating psychology to understand the factors that influence consumer behavior. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Through my studies, I gained a strong foundation in econometrics and building statistical models. I am also proficient in Python, R, SQL, Excel, and PowerBI.

        <p> 
            Outside of work, I greatly enjoy reading books about the thousands of different lives that I could be living, and I make it a goal each year to beat the number of books read from the previous year. My current favorite book is The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.
